## MILESTONE1 :-
1. Set Up the Development Environment
Installed all the necessary tools and dependencies to set up the development environment for the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project. This includes configuring the backend and frontend dependencies to ensure smooth development.
2. Understand Server-Client Interaction
Gained an understanding of how the frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Node.js/Express) using APIs. Focused on how the client sends requests to the server, and how the server processes them and sends back responses.
